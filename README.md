Codie
=======
Codie is a quick and easy to use QR code reader, completely free, and without ads. In Codie, we used Apple's new metadata reading API for AVFoundation. Very quick and completely native.

TODO
=====
- Use regex for email/phone/etc recognition instead of looking at the URL scheme for comparision.
